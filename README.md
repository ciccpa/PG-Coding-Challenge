# PG-Coding-Challenge
## C# console app to let customers enter their info and recieve an estimate.

## This application contains the following:

## Class - Program.cs
Displays console menu in main, instantiates Customer class and presents a short menu.
The user can enter their data, display it, or calculate their policy estimate which is based upon their info.

## Class - Customer.cs
Contains class information, constructors, member variables (Name, age, gender, conditions). Also has Calculate Estimate function.

### Can use Visual Studio or VSCode, anything that can run a C# Console Application. (.NET Framework)
        
Decided to create a Customer class because this opens the door for resuable code
Class has member variables and member functions to be used throughout the program and can be built upon as necessary.
        
Any changes can be made within the calculate estimate function if the policy happens to change.
